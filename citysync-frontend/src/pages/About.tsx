      <p>
        The main goal of our project is to solve the problem of information
        fragmentation for both visitors and locals. As exchange students, we
        have learned from our own experience the difficulty of finding authentic
        local events without being deeply involved in pre-existing social
        circles or specific social media groups. The information is scattered
        across dozens of platforms: university forums, little-known Facebook
        groups, coffee shop flyers, and word of mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        CitySync aims to be a centralized, reliable, and easy-to-use platform
        that brings these disparate events together. This will help users
        transform from passive observers into active participants in their
        community.
